## Overview of the analysis:

The project aims to get insight into opening a bike-sharing business in Des Moines based on Citi Bike data collected in New York. The analysis is performed on all the August 2019 data because more traffic is likely during the summer months. 

## Results:

To understand the bike-sharing business in New York City, many interactive visualizations are created in Tableau that can be filtered based on multiple criteria, such as customer type, trip duration, and gender. Two stories are designed to combine those analyses. The first story highlight the overall trend for all users, and the second story provides a more detailed analysis breakdown by gender. 

The customer type breakdown analysis of Citi Bike data shows that most bike-sharing users are subscribers (long-term users). This indicates that the bike riding business is a popular program in New York City, as shown in the image below.

The checkout times for users' plot indicates that most bike trips are ended within the first hour with a peak trip duration of 4 minutes. This analysis would help in resource planning and estimating service waiting time. Furthermore, an analysis of trips by weekday per hour is done to get a better idea of when to allocate more resources. The results show the bike sharing program is being used more during weekdays than weekends, and the peak hours for the service are between 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM. This means during those peak hours on the weekdays, and more bikes will be distributed at popular starting stations. 

The bike utilization plots are added to help better planning for bike maintenance. The bike id with a large circle size indicates that the bike id was used more frequently and is expected to need maintenance. This would help provide users with the best experience. 

The further understand Bike sharing business customers, further analysis to breakdown results by gender is performed. The results indicate that the majority of bike riders are male. The results also show that the male user group trends align with the overall trends, such as bike riding being more prevalent during weekdays than weekends, with peak hours between 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM and a peak duration of 4 minutes for the trip.
